## Setup the project

To set up the project on your localhost, follow the steps below :

#### 1) Installation and basic configuration of MongoDB database

#### 2) Clone project

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mrhosseinsalari/Freelancering-App-Backend
```

```shell
cd Freelancering-App-Backend
```

#### 3) Add environment variables

Now you need to create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file in the root directory.

#### 4) Setup project

```shell
npm install
```

```shell
npm run dev
```

Now the server is created and connected to the database. You can use it!
